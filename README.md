# Cypress-Testing

This is an example app used to showcase [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) testing. The application uses every API command in Cypress for demonstration purposes. Additionally this example app is configured to run tests in various CI platforms. The [tests](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink/blob/master/cypress/integration/examples) are also heavily commented. For a full reference of our documentation, go to [docs.cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io/).

### 1. Fork this repo

If you want to experiment with running this project in Continous Integration, you'll need to [fork](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink#fork-destination-box) it first.

After forking this project in `Github`, run these commands:

```bash
## clone this repo to a local directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cypress-example-kitchensink.git

## cd into the cloned repo
cd cypress-example-kitchensink

## install the node_modules
npm install

## start the local webserver
npm start
```

The `npm start` script will spawn a webserver on port `8080` which hosts the Kitchen Sink App.

You can verify this by opening your browser and navigating to: [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

You should see the Kitchen Sink App up and running. We are now ready to run Cypress tests.

```bash
## launch the cypress test runner
npm run cy:open
```
